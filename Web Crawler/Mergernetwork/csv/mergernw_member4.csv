I have been out of America for over 26 years.  I came back to bring a unique method of financing to existing mines of all kinds that have a NI 43-101 on the mine, if you do not have this geological report we will assist you in producing one, then you will become a qualified property. No public cos. This applies to oil & gas property as well.
