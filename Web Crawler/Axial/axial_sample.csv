"Freytag & Associates, LLC",Consultant ,San Rafael, CA,https://network.axial.net/company/jack-freytag,"Freytag & Associates was established in 2009 to provide engineering consulting services, most specifically in the fields of acoustics and vibration.  We typically partner with other industry experts in research, engineering and expert witness projects.  An outline of experience and services may be found: http://freytagllc.com/.Currently we are seeking funding for a patent-pending vibratory tool for cleaning rifle barrels.A November 2012 Congressional Research Service report found that, as of 2009, there were 110 million rifles in the U.S. and 34.4 million people shot at ranges the same year (more U.S. shooters than golfers). Today there are more rifles and shooters, and all rifles require barrel cleaning. Virtually all rifle barrel cleaning is currently done manually with a bore brush, patch and jag, and various cleaning solvents; alternatively, some also use a rope pulled through the barrel. The patent-pending vibratory tool affixes a cleaning rod with brush to a handheld (wand) vibrator so that the rifle barrel lands and grooves may be cleaned with axial vibratory motion, similar to that from an electric toothbrush. This facilitates faster, easier and more thorough cleaning than that from the conventional manual method, and without the use of harsh anti-fouling solvents that increase barrel wear. No similar device has been identified.The Vibratory Firearm Barrel Cleaning Tool may be AC-powered or cordless for use in the field. One future embodiment may move the entire cleaning rod or only the brush at the end of the rod, or it may also be used in conjunction with other patented devices to fully automate barrel cleaning by employing a mechanical system to simultaneously cycle the cleaning rod axially while supplying cleaning solvent to the brush through the hollow rod. Another embodiment uses an ultrasonic transducer for cleaning.Initially 5,000 tools may be manufactured at a unit cost of $40 each and sold for $80 each. The sale of the initial 5,000 tools would yield $400,000 for a net profit of $120,000. An assessment of the initial sales will be used to plan future production. The future potential market for this tool is extremely large. If the tool were purchased at $80 for one percent of the (year 2009) rifles, a $40 profit on each would result in a $44 million profit. Additionally foreign and military markets may be pursued, and advanced products such as a fully-automated cleaning system may be developed.The Vibratory Firearm Barrel Cleaning Tool venture offers these benefits:1) Low initial capital investment and large profit potential.2) No competition.3) Low manufacturing and marketing costs.4) Very large market potential5) Excellent market positioning    Show Less","Business Services:                                Advertising                            Distribution:                                Retail Distributors                            Financial Services:                                Diversified Financials; Investment Banking & Brokerage; Other Diversified Financial Services; Specialized Finance                            Industrials:                                Building Products; Capital Goods; Construction & Engineering                            Retail:                                Specialty Stores                            Show Less",[],,",             San Rafael, CA 94903US","Jack FreytagPresident",https://network.axial.net/company/jack-freytag
