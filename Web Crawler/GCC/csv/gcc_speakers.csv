Loral Langemeier,Loral,Langemeier,5 times New York TimesÂ Best-selling Author,"5 times New York TimesÂ Best-selling AuthorLoral LangemeierSâ€‹ought after speaker,Â money expert, â€‹entrepreneurial thought leaderâ€‹!â€‹Loral Langemeier is a money expert, sought after speaker, entrepreneurial thought leader, and best-selling author ofÂ 5Â â€‹New York Times best selling â€‹â€‹booksâ€‹Â who is on a relentless mission to change the conversation about money and empower people around the world to become millionaires.The CEO and Founder of Live Out Loud, Inc. â€“ a multinational organization â€” Loral shares her best advice without hesitation or apology. What sets her apart from other wealth experts is her innate ability to hone in on the skills and talents of everyday people to inspire them to generate wealth. She has created, nurtured, and perfected a 3-5 year strategy to make millions for the â€œAverage Jill and Joe.â€ù To date, the company has served thousands of individuals worldwide and created hundreds of millionaires through wealth building education keynotes, workshops, products, events, programs, and coaching services.Luminaries including Bob Proctor, John Gray, Jay Conrad Levinson, and Michael Gerber are powerful champions of her work. T. Harv Ecker says,â€œLoral Langemeierâ€™s investment strategies make millionaires â€“ and the best thing is that anyone can use them.â€ùLoralâ€™s straight talk electrifies audiences and inspires powerful action from live stages and television programs ranging from CNN, CNBC, The Street TV, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Channel-Americaâ€™s Nightly Scoreboard, The Dr. Phil Show and The View. She is a regular guest-host on The Circle in Australia and has been featured in articles in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Forbes Magazine and was the breakout star in the film The Secret.Growing up on her familyâ€™s farm in Nebraska, Loral was never content to sit at the little kids table for holidays or special occasions â€“ even as a nine year old. The Big Table was where the important conversations were happening, and she quickly took her place â€“ even if it meant sitting on someoneâ€™s lap. Today, she and her team call smaller players in money matters to take their seats at The Big Table as the conversations around money shift perspectives and livelihoods for the better.Loral is living proof that anyone can have the life of his or her dreams through hard work, persistence, and getting things done in the face of opposition. Loral began her career working with the Chevron Corporation right out of college. It was clear to her early on that there was more to life than cubicles and trading her time for dollars. Despite her own fears and persuasion from friends and family against it, Loral quit her job to become an executive coach. Virtually overnight, Loral quintupled her income while working much less. With her newfound freedom of time and accumulation of wealth she founded Live Out Loud, Inc.As a single mother of two children, she is redefining the possibility for women to have it all and raise their children in an entrepreneurial and financially literate environment. Loral is dedicated to helping men and women from all walks of life to become millionaires and enjoy time with their families.Legacy is something very important to Loral. She is a frequent donor to charitable groups including The Boys and Girls Club of America, The Lake Tahoe Bear League, An Empowered Woman Foundation, Life School and Family Resource Centers. She has developed special programs for women and children and, in 2012, raised $40,000 for the founder of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. She also runs Serve Out LoudÂ a program aimed at providing discounted education in financial literacy to United States Veterans.",http://thegccworld.com/members/loral-langemeier/

Most notably he is credited as being a pioneer of modern â€œcrowdfunding.â€ù He is trulyÂ a rare blend of creative passion coupled with relentless attention to detail and process. These qualitiesÂ have been the backbone and driving force behind the 13-year success of ArtistShare and the newlyÂ created Fanfunded.com, the next generation of fan funding.In 2003, Brian created ArtistShare, a state-of-the-art website and software application for the creativeÂ community to find funding for their projects directly through their fan bases. This became the blueprintÂ and precursor for many of todayâ€™s crowdfunding websites. In 2004, the first ArtistShare project won aÂ Grammy award and became the first album in history to win a Grammy that was not available in retailÂ stores. Since then ArtistShare fan-funded releases have received a total of 10 Grammy awards and 29Â Grammy nominations.Not resting on his â€œlaurels,â€ù Brian has launched an extension of the ArtistShare business model calledÂ FanFunded.com. There will now be a destination for all creative visions that extend beyond the musicÂ industry that offers opportunities to many creators that had not had the chance to participate withÂ ArtistShare.

Most notably he is credited as being a pioneer of modern â€œcrowdfunding.â€ù He is trulyÂ a rare blend of creative passion coupled with relentless attention to detail and process. These qualitiesÂ have been the backbone and driving force behind the 13-year success of ArtistShare and the newlyÂ created Fanfunded.com, the next generation of fan funding.In 2003, Brian created ArtistShare, a state-of-the-art website and software application for the creativeÂ community to find funding for their projects directly through their fan bases. This became the blueprintÂ and precursor for many of todayâ€™s crowdfunding websites. In 2004, the first ArtistShare project won aÂ Grammy award and became the first album in history to win a Grammy that was not available in retailÂ stores. Since then ArtistShare fan-funded releases have received a total of 10 Grammy awards and 29Â Grammy nominations.Not resting on his â€œlaurels,â€ù Brian has launched an extension of the ArtistShare business model calledÂ FanFunded.com. There will now be a destination for all creative visions that extend beyond the musicÂ industry that offers opportunities to many creators that had not had the chance to participate withÂ ArtistShare. As Brian expands the ArtistShare Brand and launches Fanfunded.com, there is already aÂ buzz in creative circles as he builds on past experience and success.As a pioneer in his field, he has been an invited guest speaker at Judge Business School at CambridgeÂ University, Midem, The Grammy Foundation at NARAS, ASCAP, NYU Law School, Pew Center forÂ Arts & Heritage, The Songwriters Hall of Fame, The Future of Music Coalition, George Mason School ofÂ Law, and The Juilliard School.

Unlike other companies the modelÂ is focused on the equal relationship of the Artist and the Fan creating an environment and destination forÂ the best fan support in the industry. ArtistShare projects have received countless awards andÂ accolades, including 10 Grammy awards and 29 Grammy nominations. The artist roster includesÂ some of todayâ€™s most prestigious artists, including Pulitzer prize and Oscar nominated writers,Â Guggenheim fellowship recipients, Grammy winners and NEA Jazz Masters.FanFunded, from the creators of ArtistShare, brings together fans and creators of all types.Â Offering unique engagement opportunities, the FanFunded community thrives on inspiration andÂ creativity.

What sets her apart from other wealth experts is her innate ability to hone in on the skills and talents of everyday people to inspire them to generate wealth. She has created, nurtured, and perfected a 3-5 year strategy to make millions for the â€œAverage Jill and Joe.â€ù To date, the company has served thousands of individuals worldwide and created hundreds of millionaires through wealth building education keynotes, workshops, products, events, programs, and coaching services.Luminaries including Bob Proctor, John Gray, Jay Conrad Levinson, and Michael Gerber are powerful champions of her work. T. Harv Ecker says,â€œLoral Langemeierâ€™s investment strategies make millionaires â€“ and the best thing is that anyone can use them.â€ùLoralâ€™s straight talk electrifies audiences and inspires powerful action from live stages and television programs ranging from CNN, CNBC, The Street TV, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Channel-Americaâ€™s Nightly Scoreboard, The Dr. Phil Show and The View. She is a regular guest-host on The Circle in Australia and has been featured in articles in USA Today, The Wall Street Journal, The New York Times, Forbes Magazine and was the breakout star in the film The Secret.Growing up on her familyâ€™s farm in Nebraska, Loral was never content to sit at the little kids table for holidays or special occasions â€“ even as a nine year old. The Big Table was where the important conversations were happening, and she quickly took her place â€“ even if it meant sitting on someoneâ€™s lap. Today, she and her team call smaller players in money matters to take their seats at The Big Table as the conversations around money shift perspectives and livelihoods for the better.Loral is living proof that anyone can have the life of his or her dreams through hard work, persistence, and getting things done in the face of opposition. Loral began her career working with the Chevron Corporation right out of college. It was clear to her early on that there was more to life than cubicles and trading her time for dollars. Despite her own fears and persuasion from friends and family against it, Loral quit her job to become an executive coach. Virtually overnight, Loral quintupled her income while working much less. With her newfound freedom of time and accumulation of wealth she founded Live Out Loud, Inc.As a single mother of two children, she is redefining the possibility for women to have it all and raise their children in an entrepreneurial and financially literate environment. Loral is dedicated to helping men and women from all walks of life to become millionaires and enjoy time with their families.Legacy is something very important to Loral. She is a frequent donor to charitable groups including The Boys and Girls Club of America, The Lake Tahoe Bear League, An Empowered Woman Foundation, Life School and Family Resource Centers. She has developed special programs for women and children and, in 2012, raised $40,000 for the founder of the Make-A-Wish Foundation.
