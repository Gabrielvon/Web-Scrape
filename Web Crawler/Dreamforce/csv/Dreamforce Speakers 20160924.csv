REP. JOHN LEWIS,REP.,JOHN LEWIS,Representative of the 5th Congressional District of Georgia,"Often called  ""one of the most courageous persons the Civil Rights Movement ever produced,"" Congressman John Lewis has dedicated his life to protecting human rights, securing civil liberties, and building what he calls ""The Beloved Community” in America.   His dedication to the highest ethical standards and moral principles has won him the admiration of many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle in the United States Congress.
He was born the son of sharecroppers on February 21, 1940, outside of Troy, Alabama and grew up on his family's farm and attended segregated public schools.  As a young boy, he was inspired by the activism surrounding the Montgomery Bus Boycott and the words of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.  In those pivotal moments, he made a decision to become a part of the Civil Rights Movement and ever since then, he has remained at the vanguard of progressive social movements and the human rights struggle in the United States.
 
As a student at Fisk University, John Lewis organized sit-in demonstrations at segregated lunch counters in Nashville, Tennessee. In 1961, he volunteered to participate in the Freedom Rides, which challenged segregation at interstate bus terminals across the South. By 1963, he was dubbed one of the Big Six leaders of the Civil Rights Movement. At the age of 23, he was an architect of and a keynote speaker at the historic March on Washington in August 1963. On March 7, 1965, John Lewis helped spearhead one of the most seminal moments of the Civil Rights Movement by leading over 600 peaceful, orderly protestors across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama.  They intended to march from Selma to Montgomery to demonstrate the need for voting rights in the state but were attacked by Alabama state troopers in a brutal confrontation that became known as ""BloodySunday.""  News broadcasts and photographs revealing the senseless cruelty of the segregated South helped hasten the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite more than 40 arrests, physical attacks and serious injuries, John Lewis remains a devoted advocate of the philosophy of nonviolence.   In 1986, he was elected to Congress and has served the 5th Congressional district of Georgia ever since.  He is Democratic Senior Chief Deputy Whip and a senior member of the House Ways & Means Committee.
 
John Lewis holds a B.A. in Religion and Philosophy from Fisk University, and is a graduate of the American Baptist Theological Seminary, both in Nashville, Tennessee. He is the recipient of numerous awards from eminent national and international institutions, including the highest civilian honor granted by President Barack Obama, the Medal of Freedom and the only John F. Kennedy ""Profile in Courage Award"" for Lifetime Achievement ever granted by the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation.
John Lewis lives in Atlanta, Georgia.  He has one son, John Miles.",https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/keynotes-lewis

After graduating from Indiana University - where he briefly owned the most popular bar in town - Mark moved to Dallas.

CHRISTY TURLINGTON BURNS,CHRISTY,TURLINGTON BURNS,"Founder, Every Mother Counts","Christy Turlington Burns is a mother, social entrepreneur, model, and founder of the maternal health organization, Every Mother Counts. Having endured a childbirth complication herself, Christy was compelled to direct and produce the documentary, No Woman, No Cry about maternal health challenges that impact the lives of millions of girls and women around the world. Every Mother Counts was launched at the same time as advocacy campaign to heighten awareness about our global maternal health crisis. While advocacy remains a key focus, EMC has evolved into a 501c3 investing in programs around the world to ensure all women have access to quality maternal healthcare.
Christy has been recognized as one of Time’s “100 Most Influential People” and Glamour Magazine's “Woman of The Year.” In March 2016, EMC was recognized as one of Fast Company magazines Top 10 Most Innovative Companies in Not-For-Profit.
Prior to her work as a global maternal health advocate, Christy enjoyed a successful career as a model while continuing her education and pursuing other interests.

She holds a BA from NYU’s Gallatin School of Individualized Studies and has studied Public Health at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health. A five-time marathon finisher, Christy resides in New York City where she lives with her husband, filmmaker Edward Burns, and their two children.
QUESTION
In Christy’s words why is she so passionate about her work within the maternal health space:
I became a global maternal healthcare advocate the day I became a mother nearly 12 years ago. That was the day I also became a statistic. Within an hour of delivering my daughter I hemorrhaged. If not for the competent care of a team of providers that included a doula, midwife nurses and backing OB, I might not be here today. I learned soon that hundreds of thousands of girls and women die annually from the same complication I endured and survived and other preventable causes related to pregnancy and childbirth. Then I realized there was a silver lining. I learned that 98% of these deaths are preventable and that’s when I was moved to take action. This is not an issue that needs a cure. We know how to save these women’s lives. Every Mother Counts is a campaign dedicated to making pregnancy and child safe for every mother, everywhere.",https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/keynotes-burns/

A powerful communicator, Ellis has used GLAAD’s position as the nation’s leading media advocacy organization to demand and generate coverage of LGBT Russians during the 2014 Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Under her leadership, GLAAD worked closely with Facebook to expand the social network’s gender options to be more inclusive of transgender and gender non-conforming users. And during the 2014 World Cup, Ellis’ team led an effort to demand that FIFA address anti-LGBT slurs at the games, leading broadcasters ESPN and Univision to condemn such hateful language on the air to worldwide audiences.
Ellis’ team also successfully challenged the NYC St. Patrick’s Day Parade’s ban on LGBT participation, leading two major sponsors, Heineken and Guinness, to pull their support and ultimately bring inclusion to the historic celebration. She followed this effort with the culmination of a years-long partnership between GLAAD and Scouts for Equality to end the Boy Scouts’ ban on gay youth and adult leaders.
Behind the scenes, she has positioned GLAAD as a leading advisor to media executives when it comes to dealing with the world’s biggest LGBT-related stories, including Caitlyn Jenner’s historic coming out.
Ellis’ team served as a guiding hand throughout the news cycle surrounding Jenner’s historic announcement and subsequent publicity, from Jenner’s groundbreaking interview with ABC News’ Diane Sawyer, to her Vanity Fair cover story, to her one-hour special and docu-series on the E! network. GLAAD has ensured fair and accurate media coverage that has reshaped the way people across the world see and understand the transgender community.
Ellis’ vision has expanded GLAAD’s international impact, working closely with campaigners on the ground in Ireland to help implement media strategies and best practices leading up to the country's successful marriage equality referendum.
In 2015, Ellis brought to life GLAAD’s groundbreaking “Accelerating Acceptance” report, a first-of-its-kind study that measures levels of LGBT acceptance in America beyond policy issues.
A forceful spokesperson for LGBT acceptance, Ellis’ commentary and statements have appeared in influential media including The New York Times, The Los Angeles Times, USA Today, TIME, Vanity Fair and hundreds of other outlets. 
As an insightful expert on LGBT issues, Ellis has appeared on ABC News, Bloomberg, CNN, MSNBC, Entertainment Tonight and scores of other broadcasts.
Named one of Family Circles’ 20 most influential moms in 2015, Ellis ranked 20th on the Guardian’s World Power Pride list in 2014 and was named an Agent of Change by Washington D.C.’s largest LGBT publication, Metro Weekly.

She attended Guilford College, Virginia Commonwealth University, and the San Francisco Art Institute. She was, for a time, the only licensed female taxidermist in New York City as part of her sculpture practice. Kirkland now draws attention to hundreds of species of flora and fauna in detailed oil paintings modeled after 16th- and17th century Dutch still life masters. Her life-size depictions of plants and animals are precisely rendered and anatomically accurate, the result of extensive research in the collections of natural history museums worldwide. Kirkland's work exhibits in both natural history and art museums and galleries. She is currently working on a painting of the biota of Suriname for the US State Department's ART IN EMBASSY program.",https://www.salesforce.com/dreamforce/DF16/keynotes-kirkland/
